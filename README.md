Hey there!

I’ve been a professional software developer for over sixteen years aiding the [National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA)](https://www.energy.gov/nnsa/national-nuclear-security-administration) and the [Department of Energy (DOE)](https://www.energy.gov/) in mission critical activities. My recent decade-long tenure has been at [Sandia National Laboratories (SNL)](https://www.sandia.gov), and prior to that, I worked for the [Kansas City National Security Campus (KCNSC)](https://kcnsc.doe.gov/).

I reside in [New Mexico](https://www.nm.gov/) where I keep the company of a couple of [cats](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat), and small flock of [chickens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicken), and [about an acre of land](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?key=&i=about+one+acre) where I keep claiming I’ll at some point make good use of.
